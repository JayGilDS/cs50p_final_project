## Description:
Spanish Vocabulary Learning Game is a A Python program for practicing, learning and testing Spanish vocabulary in form a of a game.

It is intended for English speakers, since the program works via an English-Spanish dictionary.

When the program is run, it prints a welcome message, and asks the user to select a level. The program has three levels, each with an increasing amount of words to be tested.
Then, the program shows the English words, one by one, and asks the user to input the Spanish equivalent of the word. If the answer is correct the program then prints “correct”, if it is wrong, the program prints “wrong” and also prints the correct answer, this way the program helps the user learn the words.
After all the leathers are tested, the program prints a score. Then, the user can continue playing and accumulate a Global Score, or exit the program.
in the program we have the following files:
- project.py: contains the python script
- test_project.py: contains the testing script to be executed with pytest
- spanish_vocab.txt: contains an English to Spanish dictionary used for the core functionality of the program.
- README.md: contains the important information about the project's program.
